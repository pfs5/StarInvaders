# Star Invaders
A fun and challenging game somehow based on the original Space Invaders and similar old arcade shooting games. The whole theme is Star Wars based resulting in the final name. The game relies on simple mechanics with cool 8bit style graphics and one-sprite explosions.

Development was done in Java with no external libraries. All art in the game is original.
